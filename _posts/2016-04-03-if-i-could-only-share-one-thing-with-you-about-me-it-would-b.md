## Hello, I'm  John Domzalski

If I could only **share one thing **with you about me it would be I genuinely love people. I believe there is only one business on Planet Earth - making someone's life better. To the degree you do that, is the degree of success you have.

I'm originally from Augusta GA. I currently reside in Atlanta Ga. I enjoy my family, cars, concerts, great restaurants, travel and all water activities.

The best thing about having my own business is Freedom to do whatever I want to do; it is fun and fullfilling.

I've worked in corporate America most of my life and learned what it means to work for someone else and be totally accountable to someone else. That got old! So then I went into my own consulting business, but then I was still trading dollars for time, and now that's got old too! Now I'm changing all that with what I mentioned earlier about making people's lives better - you'll see :)

For me, **it all started **when I was doing software consulting work with some of the largest corporations in America and still not getting ahead - trading time for money just wasn't a good plan. I was making good money. I had thought I would save 50% of my base pay for retirement. But then, the economy crashed, and my 401k turned into a 38k. So, I answered an ad online to make money from home and as they say, "The rest was history!"

### Work with John Domzalski

I look forward to working with you, and helping you to start your own home business, so that one day You can enjoy more Fun, Freedom and Fulfillment.
