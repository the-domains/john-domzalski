If you want to be happy, read this post. I've recently discovered the actual scientific formula you must follow if you want to be happy. And if you don't want to be happy, this will tell you why you're succeeding at it... 

## What Science says about Being Happy... 

Today, people called Social Scientists have a formula that anyone can follow for being Happy. **The formula is simply this:**

* H = S + C + V. H = Happiness of course. 
* S = "Set point" in the brain. 
* C = Conditions of living. 
* V = Our voluntary choices and actions we indulge in every day. 

**Your Set Point is 50% of what makes you Happy.**

So what is "Set Point"? This gets determined early in life -- the first 3 -4 years of life. The scientific name for what creates this is called "mirror neurons" which means these neurons "mirror" those people who you were around when you were 3-5 years old. 

Most of us were raised in an environment of "every situation is a problem". So if every situation is a problem, you are not happy. Fortunately, this can be changed through awareness, self reflection, quieting the mind and asking yourself "Why am I seeing this situation as a problem? Am I sure this really is a problem?".  The mindset of this "set point" determines about 50% of our existence, or how much we are happy! 

Now the conditions of our living is simply **material surroundings, it contributes about 10% to being happy.** If you are extremely poor you'll be unhappy. But get this: If you are extremely rich, you are  more likely to be unhappy. Not that extreme wealth makes you unhappy. **But anyone who gets obsessed with money as a way to measure happiness, will not be happy.**

## You can be Right, or You can Be Happy 

So all that leaves us with the choices we make every day, making up for 40% of what makes us happy. There is only two choices that make us happy -- those choices for personal pleasure and those choices for fulfillment. Both choices can make us happy, but choices for personal pleasure will make us happy for only a short time. 

Fulfillment can come from Expression of Creativity, or the betterment of a company or group. It always centers around accomplishing a goal. Ask yourself "**What choices can I make today that will create the fulfillment of a worthy goal?**". 

**The easiest way to be happy is simply making choices where the goal leads to the happiness of someone else.** Your goals can be selfish, but as you become good at that, your goals become centered around making friends and family happy. As you become good at that, your goals become more for community. As you become good at that your goals become global.

Accomplishment of any goal can make us happy, but accomplishing goals for the greater good, creates a greater feeling of 'happy' that becomes very satisfying.

> You must be Happy first, before you can truly be Successful 

One last thing the Scientist won't tell you: You can not become truly Successful, until you are first Happy. I've talked with Tony Robbins and other successful multimillionaires and they all told me the same thing: **They had to become Happy, before they became Successful...**
